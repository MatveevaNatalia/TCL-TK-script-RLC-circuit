# TCL-TK-script-RLC-circuit

This TCL/TK script calculates the current in an RLC series circuit as a function of time, 
given the values of resistance (R), inductance (L) and capacitance (C). The user can utilize 
the Graphical User Interface to set the values of these parameters and obtain an I(t) plot, 
scaled to a characteristic timescale of the circuit. This way one can explore different regimes
of behavior of the circuit.
